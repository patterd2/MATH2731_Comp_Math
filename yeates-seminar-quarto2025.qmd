## What is Quarto?

::: {.incremental}
- an *open-source scientific and technical publishing system*.
- **input**: `R markdown` with additions including $\LaTeX$, citations, cross-references, figures, callouts etc.
- some **advantages**:
    - dynamic content using `python`, `R`, `Julia`, $\ldots$
    - multiple output formats: `html`, `pdf`, `MS Word`, `ePub`, $\ldots$
- some **disadvantages**:
    - existing $\LaTeX$ needs editing.
    - limited in-built support for "theorem-like" environments.
:::

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- improving accessibility of online materials.
- `html` as the *main* format, not an afterthought.
:::
:::

### Side-benefits
::: {.incremental}
- dynamic content (drop-down boxes, figures, movies, code).
- revamped [my website](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anthony.yeates/).
- can use also for slides.

## Why prepare online notes?

## Why prepare online notes?

::: aside
cf. <https://mathoverflow.net/questions/27344/what-are-your-experiences-of-handouts-in-mathematics-lectures>
:::

::: {.incremental}
- to take pressure off students during lectures?
- to mitigate the impact of errors in lectures?
- to free up lecture time to complement/support the notes?
- to look up things from earlier?
- to structure the course?
- to keep the narrative straight?
- to make students feel like you care?
:::


## My approach

::: {.incremental}
- **complete** notes and follow them closely.
    - must be concise.
- **available** in advance, and on the web (not behind paywall).
- **readable** by clearly separating types of content.
    - clean and attractive design.
    - multiple formats for maximum accessibility.

## Example: AMV II (Michaelmas 2024)

::: {.fragment}
### Lecture notes

- `html` version hosted in my `/public_html/` directory: [https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anthony.yeates/](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anthony.yeates/amv2_202400m/).
- linked from my [homepage](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anthony.yeates/) for external visibility.
- `pdf` version uploaded to [Ultra](https://blackboard.durham.ac.uk/ultra/stream).
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Problem sheets

- both `html` and `pdf` versions on [Ultra](https://blackboard.durham.ac.uk/ultra/stream) only.
- I prepare the version with solutions first then (manually) copy and remove solutions.

## Getting started {.smaller}

:::{.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Install software from [https://quarto.org/docs/download/](https://quarto.org/docs/download/).
- I needed to install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and some packages within it.
:::
:::
::: {.fragment}
- For theorem numbering, install the [custom-numbered-blocks](https://github.com/ute/custom-numbered-blocks) extension by typing at the command line:

```{.terminal}
quarto add ute/custom-numbered-blocks
```
:::
::: {.fragment}
- I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Quarto plugin for editing.

### Templates

1. `demo-quarto-notes/` – lecture notes (`book` format).
2. `demo-quarto-problems/` – problems (individual files).
:::

## Workflow for lecture notes

- write separate `.qmd` file for each chapter.
- edit `_quarto.yml` with list of chapters, $\LaTeX$ definitions, theorem environments, and other global options.
- compile at command line:

    ```{.terminal}
    quarto render
    ```
    - by default produces all formats; add `--to html` or `--to pdf` for just one.
    - output is in the `_book/` subdirectory.

## Workflow for problem sheets

- each problem sheet is an independent `.qmd` file.
- no list of chapters in `_quarto.yml`.
- compile everything at command line with

    ```{.terminal}
    quarto render
    ```
    - or to compile just one file:
    
    ```{.terminal}
    quarto render tut1.qmd
    ```
    - output is in the `_output/` directory (set in `_quarto.yml`).
- I make the version with solutions first, then duplicate and delete solutions.

## Conclusions

::: {.incremental}
- my experience:
    - reasonable results but requires time investment.
    - can be infuriating.
    - still evolving so be prepared to make ongoing changes.
- alternative solutions for $\LaTeX$ notes $\rightarrow$ `html`:
    - [Chirun](https://chirun.org.uk) (Newcastle).
    - [BookML](https://vlmantova.github.io/bookml/) (Leeds).
